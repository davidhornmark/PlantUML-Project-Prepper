# PlantUML-Project-Prepper
This is a side project I'm working on in order to improve my Java and Multi-threading skills.

PlantUML-Project-Prepper abbr. as PUPP is a program that reads PlantUML Class Diagrams for a project and creates files for respective classes. These files contains declarations for the classes, their members and their functions.

My motivation for creating is to help me speed up the process starting up the code phase of a new project.
